## IRS channel estimation

This repository contains the source codes of the paper ``Uplink Cascaded Channel Estimation for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Multiuser MISO Systems'' which is published in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing (see <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9839429>).

In the paper, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation protocol without the need of on-off amplitude control to avoid the reflection power loss which is shown as follows. Then optimization-based channel estimation is proposed based on the protocol.

The protocol can significantly reduce the overall pilot overhead and enhance the received pilot signal power by keeping all IRS elements to be on, while the existing protocols shown as follows (referred to a protocol 2&3) require larger pilot overhead or shutting down IRS elements during training.

### Generate random channel

One may run following files in sequence according to the chanenl model in 3GPP TR 38.901:

+ ``channel_system_para_snap_elaa.m'': Random the scatters in the environment
+ ``channel_elaa_basis.m'': Calucate the channel covariances and path losses
